*"It depends."* - [Ken Forkish](https://kensartisan.com/elements-of-pizza/)

Nothing says America like the vaguely appropriated, mass-produced wheat and dairy staple that is grilled cheese... I mean pizza. Perhaps most famous in [New York](http://www.sliceharvester.com/), this dish is relentlessly remixed by the people and places who celebrate it.

There are so many pizza places here. At least 15 in Berkeley. Here are the ones that really stand out to me.

## East Bay Pizza

From my experience, there's a culturally dominant style:

* ONE type of pizza only. *"How many slices or pies ... Sorry no we don't have other kinds..."*
* Vegetarian. With extra cheeses and hella vegetables. I've eaten potatoes, artichokes, carrots, ...
* This green tangy pesto sauce that's just spicy enough to make you suck on your tongue and then take another bite in momentary dehydration.

Not every pizza is like this of course. But it's popular enough that "SF ruined pizza" (see the clip on the left). Pixar knows, they're in [Emeryville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emeryville,_California).

The best examples of this are [Cheese Board](https://cheeseboardcollective.coop/pizza/), Arizmendi's, [Nabolom](https://www.nabolombakery.com/), and [Sliver](https://www.sliverpizzeria.com/). They are all worth a try. Cheese Board and the Arizmendi shops are in an [association of cooperatives](http://arizmendibakery.coop/), which is freakin cool.


## Bobby G's
[Bobby G's](https://bobbygspizzeria.com/) feels all-American in a counterculture town. Pizza, beer, and sports? You got it. There's jazz some evenings. My fondest memory here is chowing down after a day of off-roading in [Steven](http://www.syadlowsky.com/)'s truck.

## Zachary's
[What a delight.](https://zacharys.com/) Are you having a deep-dish fantasy? The pizza is hearty; it's like if Uno's used tomato instead of bread for the filling. The spinach-and-mushroom is consistently good. And you don't need a fork, [unless you want haters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSBeXw07wGU).

## West Coast
[This is nostalgic](https://www.westcoastpizza.com/) for me; they have (1) delivery and (2) Cal student discounts. West Coast is a cheese-beats-sauce kind of place, so obviously their cheesy sticks are the specialty. Good specials. In 2020 they're so close that I just walk over.

## Arinell's
[NY-style](https://www.yelp.com/biz/arinell-pizza-berkeley-2), complete with hardass service. I like their Sicilian pizza.

## Places I haven't been
I have not yet checked out [The King's Feet](https://www.thekingsfeet.com/); vegan pizza makes me nervous.

I've heard [Little Star](https://www.littlestarsolano.com/) is good, but upscale.

[Emilia's](http://emiliaspizzeria.com/) has always intrigued me. Whenever I've gone in person, they're always sold out!

[Rotten City](http://www.rottencitypizza.com/) seems neat, right by [Prizefighter](https://www.prizefighterbar.com/) and the Berkeley Aquatic park. I've stopped by on a full stomach; they have big slices (but not [Jumbo Slice](https://dc.eater.com/2016/12/14/13883596/jumbo-slice-crawl-dc-pizza-mart-bolis-rankings#jumbo-slice-at-pizza-mart) big...)
