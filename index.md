*"It depends."* - [Ken Forkish](https://kensartisan.com/elements-of-pizza/)

Nothing says America like the vaguely appropriated, mass-produced wheat and dairy staple that is grilled cheese... I mean pizza. Perhaps most famous in [New York](http://www.sliceharvester.com/), this dish is relentlessly remixed by the people and places who celebrate it.

## What does pizza look like in the Bay?

from my experience, the East Bay in particular has a culturally dominant style:

* ONE type of pizza only. "How many slices or pies, sorry no we don't have other kinds" (unless you want it gluten-free)
* Vegetarian. With extra cheeses and hella vegetables (I've eaten potatoes, artichokes, carrots, ...)
* This green tangy pesto sauce that's just spicy enough to make you suck on your tongue and then take another bite in momentary dehydration

Not every pizza is like this, of course. But it's popular enough that "SF ruined pizza" (see the clip on the left).

More to come..
